   <p>My name is Oguz Konya, I’m a mathematician and a game developer. I currently work as a Game Client Engineer II at DIGIT Game Studios in Dublin. This is my blog where I share my experience which I gained while tackling math and software problems throughout my career. I occasionally rant, too. You can contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oguzkonya/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.digitgaming.com/">DIGIT Game Studios</a>, Dublin — Game Client Engineer II<br />
<small>July 2020 - Present</small><br />
Star Trek Fleet Command is DIGIT’s main focus at the moment and I am working as a front end developer for the content tech team which is responsible for developing new features and fixing bugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://gram.gs">Gram Games</a>, Istanbul — Senior Game Developer<br />
<small>May 2016 - June 2020</small><br />
Gram Games started as a casual mobile game development company, then quickly moved into IAP based games. I worked on many projects there, but I am mostly proud of three of them: Bounzy!, Merge Dragons! and Merge Magic!.</p>
<p><a href="http://dodisoft.com/">Dodisoft Games</a>, Istanbul — Game Developer<br />
<small>July 2014 - May 2016</small><br />
Our main objective at Dodisoft was to clone successful mobile games. I developed a mobile FPS game, a Minecraft clone and a simple racing game.</p>
<p>Pargass Technology, Ankara — Game Developer<br />
<small>July 2013 - July 2014</small><br />
Pargass was a short lived company, however, I was able to develop a driving simulation for driver’s education schools in that short amount of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://simsoft.com.tr/">Simsoft Computer Technologies</a>, Ankara — Software Developer<br />
<small>July 2011 - July 2013</small><br />
Simsoft’s portfolio includes remote learning systems, serious games and simulations which I worked on as a developer during my time there.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Star Trek Fleet Command</strong> — DIGIT Game Studios<br />
<small>Game Client Engineer - 2020</small><br />
Star Trek Fleet Command is a mobile open world strategy MMO game developed by DIGIT Game Studios and published by Scopely and CBS. Players explore the galaxy while mining resources, building ships, forming alliances and battling against the AI and each other. My main responsibility is providing technical support to live operations and building new features.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Magic!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Senior Developer - 2019</small><br />
Merge Magic! is a clone of Merge Dragons! with a mythical creatures theme. We forked Merge Dragons! code base and refactored the code to use our own servers and configuration. As the senior developer, I am mainly working on new features (both architecture and implementation), and I recently implemented the season pass feature.</p>
<p><strong>1010! Color</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Senior Developer - 2019</small><br />
1010! Color is a variation of 1010!: instead of completing whole rows or columns, players merge 3+ of the same color. I implemented this mechanic on 1010!</p>
<p><strong>Merge Dragons!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Senior Developer - 2018</small><br />
Merge Dragons! is the flagship title and IP of Gram Games. It is a merge-3 game developed around a dragon theme. My main task in the project was to implement 4 events (Summer, Pet, Summer-2, Zen), a “push offer” system which serves customized offers to segmented players, and an asset bundle management service which serves assets through bundles.</p>
<p><strong>Live Title Operations</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Liveops - 2018</small><br />
Gram Games has its own GDPR framework which has a very responsive flow and UI. I implemented it in all Gram Games’ titles.</p>
<p><strong>Tanks!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2018</small><br />
Tanks! is a match-3 game with a fighting meta similar to Best Fiends. It was separated into 3 sub-projects: battle, deck and board. I was the developer of board systems. The project was cancelled after 3 months of development due to rather large scope and a lack of resources.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Factory!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2018</small><br />
Merge Factory! is a merge-3 idle game with a factory theme. Players merge scrap metals to create machines which produce better scrap metals which make better machines. I worked on the implementation of factory robots, power ups and store systems. The title is pulled from stores after failing to meet target KPIs.</p>
<p><strong>Bounzy!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Lead Developer - 2017</small><br />
Bounzy is an ad-monetized clone of BBTAN in the world of magic. Players shoot spells to defeat incoming enemies and earn gold. They upgrade their spells in order to fight more powerful enemies. It features a leaderboard, a tournament mode and localisation as well as social features. Bounzy! has an average of 300k DAU, and was featured both on the App Store and Play Store. I was the lead developer of the project and coded the main architecture and most of the game systems.</p>
<p><strong>Hungry Cat!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2017</small><br />
Hungry Cat! is an iteration on Gram Games’ Merged! game. It was pulled off the store after failing to meet target KPIs.</p>
<p><strong>Soulstone!</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2016</small><br />
Soulstone is a mid-core game with a match-3 core gameplay and an RPG meta gameplay. The development was cancelled due to low KPIs.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype Template</strong> — Gram Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2016</small><br />
Gram Games produces prototypes rapidly and this template serves as a starting point for those prototypes. All the services and systems apart from the gameplay itself are already present in this template (user service, database service, analytics service, menu system, score system etc). I developed the entire template.</p>
<p><strong>Call of Battlefield</strong> — Dodisoft Games<br />
<small>Developer - 2015</small><br />
Call of Battlefield is an FPS zombie survival game. It features both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, 6 maps, 12 enemies, 14 upgradeable weapons and a very small footprint (44MBs). I implemented the networking and weapon systems.</p>
